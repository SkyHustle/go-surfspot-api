# Surf Spots Api

A simple REST API built using No third-party packages/dependencies

## Requirements

* [x] `GET /surfspots` returns list of surfspots as JSON
* [x] `GET /surfspots/{id}` returns details of specific surfspot as JSON
* [x] `GET /admin` requires basic auth
* [x] `GET /surfspots/random` redirects (Status 302) to a random surfspot
* [x] `POST /surfspots` accepts a new surfspot to be added
* [x] `POST /surfspots` returns status 415 if content is not `application/json`
* `DELETE /surfspots/{id}` returns an empty object {}
* `PUT /surfspots/{id}` returns the updated surfspot as JSON

* Each endpoint should have a test

```json

  "founder": "the name of the person who found the sufspotspot",
  "beach": "name of the beach the surfspot is located at",
